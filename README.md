# Bugsnax API

üêõ The only public, open-source API for the game Bugsnax by Young Horses.

## Running locally

cd bugsnax-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## API Reference

The api runs on the format:

`https://bugsnaxapi.com/api/<category>/<index>`

For example, `https://www.bugsnaxapi.com/api/bugsnax` will return a list of all bugsnax.

Options for each are as follows:

#### category

```
"bugsnax"
"locations"
"grumpuses"
```

#### index

The index can be either an integer or a string.

If it is an integer, it will return the object at that index.

If it is a string, it will return the an object who's name matches that string. Spaces can either be removed or replaced with a dash to work.

#### Errors

If any of the parameters are not from the above, you will see one of the following errors:

```
"Error: Invalid index"
"Error: Invalid name"
```

If you see an error not included in this list, there may be an issue with the API, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/samuel-pratt/bugsnax-api/issues/new)
